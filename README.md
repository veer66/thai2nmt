This repository includes code to reproduce our experiments on Thai-English NMT models and scripts to download the datasets (`scb-mt-en-th-2020`, `mt-opus` and `scb-mt-en-th-2020+mt-opus`) along with the train/validation/test split that we used in the experiments. 

Our experiments are listed below.

- [Experiment #1 TBASE.SCB-1M](./experiments/TBASE.SCB-1M.md) -- Transformer BASE models trained on [scb-mt-en-th-2020 v1.0](https://github.com/vistec-AI/dataset-releases/releases/tag/scb-mt-en-th-2020_v1.0)
  

- [Experiment #2 TBASE.MT-OPUS](./experiments/TBASE.MT-OPUS.md) -- Transformer BASE models trained on English-Thai datasets listed in [Open Parallel Corpus (OPUS)](http://opus.nlpl.eu/)
